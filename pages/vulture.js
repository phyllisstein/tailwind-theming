          Clay said, "Lookâ€¦ we're coming out once a week, right?
          And <span style={{ fontStyle: 'normal' }}>The New Yorker</span> comes out
          once a week. And we start out the week the same way they do,
          with blank paper and a supply of ink. Is there any reason we
          can't be as good as <span style={{ fontStyle: 'normal' }}>The
          New Yorker</span>?"
